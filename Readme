Summary
I have experience in creating CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins and TeamCity. During my work as DevOps in my previous positions, I organised from scratch the CI/CD process in Jenkins using Docker, Docker-compose and Kubernetes for the C++ applications and hardware testing.
Ansible was used for the infrastructure automation and software update/installation in this project.
In my last position, I use IBM uDeploy, Openshift, AWS S3 and Artifactory setup to manage releases. Microsoft Ambrosia and Azure were used while migrating the bank trading application to microservice architecture. 
Also, my responsibilities are hardware selection and firewall provisioning.
I have extensive experience in using and constantly working in Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, RHEL..) and writing scripts (Bash, Python). I understand Unix architecture, processes, rights and file systems.
I know Linux package managers, patching and package creation process.
Additionally, my previous experience in C/C++ programming is 6 years. The software framework for robotics projects was written by me.
The build system of the framework is based on Cmake. Git was the primary versioning system.
Python is the language for generating code and specific internal operations for this framework.

I’m ready to help people and enjoy it. I learn very easily in technical fields.
My credo is responsibility for what I have created and automation wherever it is appropriate.
